## What info does it contain?
There're few articles teaching specific subjects: 
* Variables
* Input/output streams
* Basic operators
* Logic operators
* Cycles
* Strings
All the knowledge will make you able to write simple java code required to code some basic algorithms
## How does it work?
The main part of it is the gamification: every finished task grants the user with the points that are used to close the day sprint (to reach the goal)
Everything can be done "on the go": if user has small amount of free time, he may finish few "choice questions", otherwise consider reading articles and finishing
code-writing tasks: he can be asked to write the code that does certain job given in the task. All of these actions will contribute to finishing the daily goal.
## Articles
Articles are pieces of text with general info about the subject. User may mark it as read [that will be counted on the progress screen]
